Android-Fluxify
===============

What is it
----------

This is a simple lib and application that aims to handle all the boilerplate code in a FLUX oriented application.

Spirit of the project
---------------------

In theory this should be as similar as possible to the Facebook's flux tutorial, so you shouldn't be so much distant if you came from flux on the javascript side.
